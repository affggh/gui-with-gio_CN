你想找一个 GUI. 这就来了.

你知道 Go 有一个非常棒的 GUI 库叫做 [Gio](https://gioui.org/)吗? 在 [10部分教学](https://jonegil.github.io/gui-with-gio/egg_timer/) 中我们将完全从头开始, 不需要任何基础, 
并构建一个独立的 GUI 应用程序:

[Get started - Time the egg](https://jonegil.github.io/gui-with-gio/egg_timer/)

## And there's more
The first tutorial will get you started. But if your needs are more advanced, continue with [a more advanced app](https://jonegil.github.io/gui-with-gio/teleprompter/) where we build a Teleprompter that adds animation and reacts to user input, both keyboard shortcut keys and mouse gestures.

## Background

Command-lines are great and all, but let's face it, 95% of users aren't power users. They want buttons to push, toggles to switch and simply get on with their lives. Enter [Gio](https://gioui.org/) - a great toolkit to build stunningly beautiful, lightning fast, flexible interfaces that meet _your_ needs.

### Three out of three

For an interface to work, it must be:

1. **Beautiful**
   - No one will use an app that looks like #$%$#!"#
2. **Fast**
   - Snappy, instant, responsive, immediate, direct
   - Quick to code, easy to test
3. **Flexible**
   - Fit _your_ needs, _your_ ideas, _your_ principles
   - Not impose it's will on you
   - Simple should be simple, complex should be allowed

1 and 2 and 3. Beautiful AND Fast AND Flexible. No compromises.

### Just do it

_But I don't know how_

Agreed, the [official Gio website](https://gioui.org) is a bit advanced. [Nice repos exist](https://github.com/gioui) with many examples, but where to start? If you're a practical learner, you simply want to get started, code something simple, and learn as you go along. That's me at least, and if you're like that too, we're soulmates.

So let's just do exactly that. The point here is to build something simple, from the ground up, and touch upon concepts and ideas as we go along. Every step moves us forward, and every new feature builds on something we've touched upon before. The goal is to change the initial _I don't know_ to a more optimistic _I don't know how - yet_.

Come along for the ride!

#### Disclaimer

I really like Gio, I like the people behind it, I sponsor it financially, and I want it to succeed. But I´m by no means an expert. My goal is simply to share what I've learned in the hope that you find it useful. Hope that works.

Cheers

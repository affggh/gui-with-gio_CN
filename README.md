你想找一个 GUI， 这里就有一个。

你知道 Go 有一个非常棒的 GUI 库叫做 [Gio](https://gioui.org/)吗? 在 [10部分教学](https://jonegil.github.io/gui-with-gio/egg_timer/) 中我们将完全从头开始, 不需要任何基础, 
并构建一个独立的 GUI 应用程序:

## 还有更多

第一个教程将帮助您入门。 但如果您的需求更高级，请继续 [一个更高级的app](https://jonegil.github.io/gui-with-gio/teleprompter/) 我们构建了一个提词器，它添加动画并对用户输入（包括键盘快捷键和鼠标手势）做出反应。

## 背景

命令行固然很棒，但我们还是需要面对现实，95% 的用户都不是高级用户。他们想要按下按钮，切换开关，然后简单地继续他们的生活。 [Gio](https://gioui.org/) - 一个很棒的工具包，可以构建令人惊叹的美丽、快如闪电、灵活的界面，满足 _your_ 的需求.

### 三部曲

要使接口正常工作，它必须是:

1. **美观**
   - No one will use an app that looks like #$%$#!"#
2. **迅速**
   - Snappy, instant, responsive, immediate, direct
   - Quick to code, easy to test
3. **灵活**
   - Fit _your_ needs, _your_ ideas, _your_ principles
   - Not impose it's will on you
   - Simple should be simple, complex should be allowed

1 and 2 and 3. Beautiful AND Fast AND Flexible. No compromises.

### Just do it

_But I don't know how_

Agreed, the [official Gio website](https://gioui.org) is a bit advanced. [Nice repos exist](https://github.com/gioui) with many examples, but where to start? If you're a practical learner, you simply want to get started, code something simple, and learn as you go along. That's me at least, and if you're like that too, we're soulmates.

So let's just do exactly that. The point here is to build something simple, from the ground up, and touch upon concepts and ideas as we go along. Every step moves us forward, and every new feature builds on something we've touched upon before. The goal is to change the initial _I don't know_ to a more optimistic _I don't know how - yet_.

Come along for the ride!

#### Disclaimer

I really like Gio, I like the people behind it, I sponsor it financially, and I want it to succeed. But I´m by no means an expert. My goal is simply to share what I've learned in the hope that you find it useful. Hope that works.

Cheers
